NOTE: The following License doesn't apply
The files are almost all marked Copyright Venue.
We don't think Venue was a corporation (not sure) but believe it was the DBA for John Sybalsky.

Some of the files are marked Copyright Venu and Fuji Xerox, but it seems they are separate files for support of systems we no longer need to support.

Our intention is to set this all with a MIT License

but we're not quite there yet
